1. Reports:
   
   I have created a report based on Retail Analysis

 A .  Overview Page:

In This Page, I created a map chart that shows the store locations under the District Manager Where you can filter the map by selecting Manager from the list.



  B. Territories:

   On the Territories Page, I used a check Box filter where you can choose one or more territories. Once you select the territory ArcGIS will automatically Zoom in on that Territory Pointing out the City having the store location. The gauge will display This year's sales and this year's sales Goal in the Territory selected. You can also select multiple territories by pressing ctrl key.

   

   
2. Dashboard:

Over here,  I have created a Dashboard where you can filter Total Units this year by buyer using a Treemap and I also created a Stacked Bar chart to show Total Units Last Year and Total Units this year by Category.
